Number 1
UserFirstName=input("enter your first name")
UserLastName=input("enter your last name")
print("Hello" + " " + UserLastName+ " " +UserFirstName)


Number 2
Accept an integer (n) input from the user and compute the value of n+nn+nnn.
For example if n=4 then n + nn + nnn = 4 + 44 + 444 = 492

UserInput= int(input("enter a number"))
x = int( "%s" % UserInput)
x2 = int( "%s%s" % (UserInput,UserInput) )
x3 = int( "%s%s%s" % (UserInput,UserInput,UserInput) )
y=x+x2+x3
print(str(x)+ "+"+ str(x2)+ "+" + str(x3)+"="+str(y))

number 3
Country=input("what country are you from \n")
print(" I have heard that " + Country+ " is beautiful country!")

#number 4
What is the output of the following Python code
x = 10
y = 50
if (x ** 2 > 100 and y < 100): ** is an asterik
    print(x, y)


The code does not exeute through the loop because x**2 is equal to 100 not more

number 5
a = [10, 20]
b = a
b +=[30, 40]
print(a)
print(b)
the answer is [10,20,30, 40] for both a and b because the lists are concetanated into one

number 6
What is the output of the following code and what arithmetic operators is being used here?
print(2%6)
this is the modulus operator and the answer is 0 because there is no numerator

number 7
What is the output of the following code and what arithmetic operators are used here? print(2 * 3 ** 3 * 4)
these are the multiplication(*) and the power (*) operations
the answer is 216: 2 * 27*4
